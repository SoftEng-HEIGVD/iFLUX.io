========

Welcome to the repo of the iFLUX project, part of the iNUIT research programme at the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland (HES-SO).

## Organization of the repo

At the moment, there are two main branches in the repo:

* the **master** branch, which contains the code base for the different components (server, client SDKs, examples, etc.).

* the **gh-pages** branch, which contains the sources for the www.iflux.io web site and for the REST API documentation (available at http://www.iflux.io/api). The web site is developed with the Jekyll generator. The REST API documentation is developed with the apidoc-seed project.

* Be aware that the two branches do not have any overlap in terms of content. The gh-pages branch only contains the sources for the website, following the standard GitHub Pages model.
