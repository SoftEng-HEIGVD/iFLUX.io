						<h2>Context</h2>
            <p><b>iFLUX</b> is an ongoing project, conducted in the broader context of the <b>iNUIT</b> research programme at the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland. Whereas iNUIT intends to create a complete <b>IoT stack for smart city applications</b>, iFLUX focuses more particularly on the <b>middleware layer</b>. Our goal is to build an event-driven, rule-based environment that will make it easier to integrate the various iNUIT components and to automate urban workflows.</p>

								<h3>Towards Reactive Cities</h3>
								<p>Sensors and actuators are increasingly deployed in urban environments. Cities are becoming smart environments, where it is possible to react to the occurence of all sorts of events.</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						<div class="4u">
							<section class="box special">
								<i class="icon major fa-random"></i>
								<h3>Lightweight Integration</h3>
								<p>The iNUIT platform consists of many components: sensors, data processing modules, application services, UI agents. iFlux makes it easy to wire them together, with a rule-based approach.</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						<div class="4u">
							<section class="box special">
								<i class="icon major fa-cloud"></i>
								<h3>Cloud Infrastructure</h3>
								<p>The iFLUX middleware stack is built on top of leading edge frameworks and tools. From containers to scalable event processing components, we intend to build a robust and scalable platform.</p>

						<h2>Events, Events. Events Everywhere.</h2>
						<p>A train arrives at the station. The pollution level has reached a critical threshold. There is a traffic jam in Grand-Rue. A street light needs to be repaired. The park is crowded. A fire truck has left the fire station. </p>
					</header>

						<div class="6u">
							<section class="box special">
								<i class="icon major alt fa-bolt"></i>
								<h3>Event Driven</h3>
								<p>Reactive urban applications are all about processing flows of events. Within the iNUIT stack, iFLUX provides a scalable and flexible middleware layer to collect and process the events triggered by the other components. We rely on open source projects, including Apache Kafka and Apache Storm.</p>

						</div>
						<div class="6u">
							<section class="box special">
								<i class="icon major alt fa-gears"></i>
								<h3>Rule Based</h3>
								<p>iFLUX has been inspired by services such as IFTTT, Zapier and others. We love their simple approach to service integration and workflow automation. Our goal is to make it easy to build application-level processes on top of the diverse components delivered by the different iNUIT projects.</p>

								<h3>Container Ready</h3>
								<p>We see a lot of value in micro-services and portable containers. We rely on Docker and related technologies to support different execution environments. From a developer's laptop to a private or public cloud, we want to make it straightforward to get an iFLUX environment up and running.</p>
							</section>
						</div>
						<div class="6u">
							<section class="box special">
								<i class="icon major alt fa-github-square"></i>
								<h3>Generic &amp; Open</h3>
								<p>While iFLUX addresses specific needs of the iNUIT research programme, we believe that it has broader applicability. In essence, we are building an open scalable rule-based platform that can benefit any situation where users want to easily specify what should happen when certain events happen.</p>
